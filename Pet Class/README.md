The `Pet` class represents a pet and provides methods to set and retrieve its name, animal type, and age.

## Class Description

The `Pet` class has the following data attributes:

- `__name`: The name of the pet.
- `__animal_type`: The type of animal that the pet is.
- `__age`: The age of the pet.

The class provides the following methods:

- `__init__(self, name, animal_type, age)`: Constructor that initializes a `Pet` object with the specified name, animal type, and age.

- `set_name(self, name)`: Sets the name of the pet.

- `set_animal_type(self, animal_type)`: Sets the animal type of the pet.

- `set_age(self, age)`: Sets the age of the pet.

- `get_name(self) -> str`: Returns the name of the pet.

- `get_animal_type(self) -> str`: Returns the animal type of the pet.

- `get_age(self) -> int`: Returns the age of the pet.

## Program Description

The program creates a `Pet` object and prompts the user to enter the name, type, and age of their pet. The entered data is stored as the object's attributes. The program then uses the object's accessor methods to retrieve the pet's name, type, and age and displays this data on the screen.
