The `Car` class represents a car and provides methods to control its speed and retrieve the current speed.

## Class Description

The `Car` class has the following data attributes:

- `__year_model`: The car's year model.

- `__make`: The make of the car.

- `__speed`: The car's current speed.

The class provides the following methods:

- `__init__(self, year_model, make)`: Constructor that initializes a `Car` object with the specified year model and make. It sets the speed to 0.

- `accelerate()`: Increases the car's speed by 5.

- `brake()`: Decreases the car's speed by 5.

- `get_speed() -> int`: Returns the car's current speed.

## Program Description

The program creates a `Car` object and calls the `accelerate` method five times. After each call, it retrieves the current speed and displays it. Then, it calls the `brake` method five times, retrieves the current speed, and displays it.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

To run this program, you need to have Python installed on your system.

### Usage

1. Clone the repository or download the script ClassCar.py.

2. Open your terminal or command prompt and navigate to the directory where the script is located.

3. Run the script using the command: `python ClassCar.py`.

4. The program will output the current speed of the car after each acceleration and braking action.

### Sample Output

The output of the test program will display the year model, make, and speed of the `Car` objects.
